Elf.pov runs smooth in povray so long as the two include 
files are in the same folder as the .pov file.

*note* 
my candle2 include file is different from 
the one on the lohmueller site

Rendering took me anywhere from 1-8 minutes
 depending on the resolution and image quality.


each image in the folder is a screenshot from 
one of the 7 camera angles I used.

Full scene and city view side or camera 6 and 1 
respectively are my two favorites.

I got the idea for this scene from the scene in the
 second hobbit movie where smaug is attacking the city 
on the water and tried to put an elven spin on the architecture.
